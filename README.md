When developing a project with springboot, with the expansion of business, the number of databases needs to change from one to multiple, so we need to configure multiple data sources. 

This project is based on Spring-data-jpa to configure multiple data sources. I hope it will be helpful to you. 

For the configuration process, please refer to my blog: https://blog.csdn.net/jim_LoveQ/article/details/108362754. 

If you have any questions, you can leave a comment on your blog for discussion.
